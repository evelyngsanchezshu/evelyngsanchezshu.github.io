        Climate Change Researcher · American Institutes for Research

      <p>
        Interested in research at the intersection of climate and people. Specifically, I’m focused on climate impacts and resiliency as related to human systems such as urbanization, housing, energy systems, and food and water networks. 
        I’ve worked within the US and globally to quantify climate impacts to issues such as infrastructure, property values, migration, agriculture and food security, health, and community resilience. I primarily use R in my research, but am comfortable using and learning additional languages. In addition, I’ve published over a dozen peer reviewed papers, such as a first author paper in Nature Communications.

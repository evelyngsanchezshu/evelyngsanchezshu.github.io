      <h3>Geospatial Science and Econometrics for Climate Change Impacts</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Climate Change Researcher · American Institutes for Research
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Evelyn G Sanchez-Shu is interested in understanding the intersection of climate impacts and people. 
        Specifically, her research is focused on climate impacts, risk, and resiliency as related to human systems such as urbanization, housing, energy systems, and food and water networks. 
        She's worked within the US and globally to quantify climate impacts to various socioeconomic systems, such as infrastructure, property values, migration, agriculture and food security, health, and community resilience. <br>
        She leverages interdisciplinary research approaches (across applied economics, GIS, data science and machine learning, spatial sociology and demography, and environmental science) and big data (e.g., remote sensing, hazard models, housing and infrastucture records, insurance records, national surveys) to answer research questions.
        She primarily uses R in her research, but is comfortable using and learning additional languages. She has experience in R, Python, JavaScript (for GEE), Stata, and SQL. <br>
        Shu has published over a dozen peer reviewed papers (such as first author in Nature Communications). She has led and co-led several papers and national reports which were covered in national news outlets (The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, etc.). <br>
        She has a master's in Applied Economics and Management from Cornell University and a BSc in Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning from the University of California, Davis.
